client  initiate req on url and need some mechanism process the request and then give response to the client 
using http module we can setup a basic server 

http module have a function called create server 
this createserver func take callback as input 
now inside the callback we get two arguments 
-->request=this argument contain all the detail about incoming req
-->response= =this argumnet contain func using which wecan prep the response 

the create server function return us the server object 


what is the port?? logical endpoints
