computer network
network --> group or system of interconnected people or item bunch of computer interconnected is called 
computer network

internet --> in  a nutshell internet is a network of computer network complex web of interconnected computer networks 


history of internet 
1957-->soviet union--> sputnik satellite
1957-->US-->ARPA(advance research project agency)
during 1960-70 US developed communication system for ARPA computer to share information 
in 1969 ARPANET was developed 

around 1980's they started transmiting to new protocol called as TCP/IP and in these times ARPANET is called 
as internet 
in 1990 CERN (council of europian research) also want to exchange/share  their information for their hyperlink 
based docs 

in 1990 tim berner lee introduced WWW
so intial some browser came was mosac and netscape

protocols
protocols are set of rule and regulation setup to communicate and share information over a network 
example--> HTTP,UDP,TCP, SMTP etc

packets 
in order to share data we cant sent big chunk of data over a network so we divide the data to be sent into 
smaller chunks and these smaller chunks is called packet

Address 
sending messages over a network require the destination details this details uniquly identify the end system
is called as address 

ports 
any machine could be running many network apps in order to distinguish these apps for receiving messages we 
use ports (port number)
IP address+port ==> socket 

port help you get the packet to specific process on the host 
every process has a 16bit port number 0-2^16=65535(range of port number )

0-1023-> well known ports 
example 
port 80 belongs to HTTP
port 443 belongs to https

1024-49152--> registered ports 
the are used by specific potentially properitary apps/process that are known but not system defined 
example
mysql-->1433
mongodb-->27017

49152-65535-->dynamic ports 

            access networks 
            these are media using which end systems connect to internet 
            example--> wifi,telephone line

            network interface adapter--> it enable a computer to attach to a network as there are different type of network it 
            act as a single suit to connect to any network 

DSL(digital subscriber line)--> DSL uses existing telephone groundwork lines for internet connection 
generally DSL provided by same company which supplies telephone services 

ISP(internet service provider )-->it just a company that provides end users internet 
example-->AT&T
