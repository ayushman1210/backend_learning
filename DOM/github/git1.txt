git init--> initialize the git repository (folder managed by git where we can track all the changes we are making in project)
a new version ---> a new commit 
if we have to create a new version we need to create a new commit 

git add <filename> ---> git start tracking to change to the file 
git commit -m "message"-->this create a new verison based on your prv change 

git log --> how many commit we done
